# Sleep
Many classical methods have been used in automatic sleep stage classification but few methods explore deep learning. Meanwhile, most deep learning methods require extensive expertise and suffer from a mass of handcrafted steps which are timeconsuming. In this paper, we propose an efficient convolutional neural network, Sle-CNN, for five-sleep-stage classification. We attach each kernel in the first layers with a learnable coefficient to enhance the learning ability and flexibility of the kernel. Then, we make full use of the genetic algorithmâ€™s heuristic search and the advantage of no need for the gradient to search for the sleep stage classification architecture. We verify the convergence of Sle-CNN and compare the performance of traditional convolutional neural networks before and after using the learnable coefficient. Meanwhile, we compare the performance between the Sle-CNN generated through genetic algorithm and the traditional convolutional neural networks. The experiments demonstrate that the convergence of Sle-CNN is faster than the normal convolutional neural networks and the Sle-CNN generated by genetic algorithm outperforms the traditional handcrafted counterparts too. Our research suggests that deep learning has a great potential on electroencephalogram signal processing especially with the intensification of neural architecture search. Meanwhile, neural architecture search can exert greater power in practical engineering applications. We conduct the Sle-CNN with the Python library, Pytorch, and the code and models will be publicly available.
